### Running the bot
First, we need to install the dependencies in order for the bot to run correctly. From the root, just execute the following command.
```
npm install
```
That's it, we're ready to run the bot, just use this script:
```
npm run start
```
And that's all, you can now interact with your bot using Telegram.
